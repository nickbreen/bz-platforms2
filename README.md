[![Bazel CI](https://github.com/nickbreen/bz-platforms2/actions/workflows/bazel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nickbreen/bz-platforms2/actions/workflows/bazel.yml)

Assumptions: you have `bazelisk` on your path as `bazel` and a recent `docker`.

Emulate remote builds with the experimental docker strategy:

    ( cd executors; docker buildx bake )
    bazel test --config docker //:platform-{hello,tar,deb,rpm}-test-suite

Start a local instance of BuildBuddy with remote execution enabled and your API
Key configured in `~/.bazelrc` 
as `build:remote --remote_header=x-buildbuddy-api-key=[REDACTED]`:
    
    docker compose up -d
    bazel test --config remote //:platform-{hello,tar,deb,rpm}-test-suite

Use BuildBuddy Cloud and your API Key configured in `~/.bazelrc` 
as `build:bb --remote_header=x-buildbuddy-api-key=[REDACTED]`: 

    bazel test --config bb //:platform-{hello,tar,deb,rpm}-test-suite

Bazel will cache the outputs and results, so you'll need to invalidate them if 
you want to run these builds/tests repeatedly.

`.bazelrc` configures an environment variable `FUDGE` that can be set to a new
value to invalidate all build outputs and test results. E.g.

    export FUDGE="$(date)"

We want to target various platforms:

    OS             Family  PKG GLIBC GCC                  
    -------------- ------ ---- ----- -------
    centos:6       redhat  RPM  2.12   4.4.7  
    centos:7       redhat  RPM  2.17   4.8.5    
    debian:11      debian  DEB  2.31  10.2.1        
    debian:12      debian  DEB  2.36  12.2.0                 
    fedora:37      redhat  RPM  2.36  12.3.1     
    fedora:38      redhat  RPM  2.37  13.2.1     
    rockylinux:8   redhat  RPM  2.28   8.5.0    
    rockylinux:9   redhat  RPM  2.34  11.3.1     
    ubuntu:focal   debian  DEB  2.31   9.4.0          
    ubuntu:jammy   debian  DEB  2.35  11.4.0          

We could use https://github.com/wheybags/glibc_version_header
to link to lowest-common denominator GLIBC symbols. But, glibc 2.34 has a
hard break where you cannot compile with 2.34 and have it work with older
glibc versions even if you use those version headers. It will always
link `__libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.34`.

We could reduce the compilations down to GNU libc 2.12 and 2.34 as the two
lowest common version and then package; this assumes that GNU libc is the only
compilation dependency with some version issue. Consider GCC, or adding OpenSSL too...

So, we sort of have a sparse matrix of:

GLIBC versions:
- 2.12
- 2.17
- 2.28
- 2.31
- 2.34 *** backwards-incompatible change: `__libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.34`!
- 2.36
- 2.37

GCC versions:
- 4.4.7
- 4.8.5
- 8.5.0
- 9.4.0
- 10.2.1
- 11.3.1
- 11.4.0
- 12.2.0
- 12.3.1
- 13.2.1

Packaging Type & OS Family:
- RPM & RedHat-likes
- DEB & Debian-likes
- TGZ

RPM version:
- 4.8.0
- 4.11.3
- 4.14.3
- 4.16.1.3
- 4.18.1

Python version:
- 3.4.10
- 3.6.8
- 3.6.8
- 3.8.10
- 3.9.16
- 3.9.2
- 3.10.12
- 3.11.2
- 3.11.4
- 3.11.5

So, to target various combinations of these tools' versions we need to be clever-er.

The idea will be to build `hello.c` for each of these platforms and
"automatically" build it in a matching container. The extra nice part of this
is that the host platform is now entirely irrelevant.

---

What next?

- We might also want one for the host system too, whatever that is.
- Musl libc and Alpine!

Problems...

1. Failures on Ubuntu 23.04/lunar with docker provided by Ubuntu's docker.io package. 

       bazel test --config docker //:platform-{hello,tar,deb,rpm}-test-suite --keep_going
   
   >     FAIL: //:platform-rpm-test_0_centos/6 (see /home/nick/.cache/bazel/_bazel_nick/536d4a2f7bb7c864cad311a4771d7d40/execroot/_main/bazel-out/k8-fastbuild-ST-8ca70333f868/testlogs/platform-rpm-test_0_centos/6/test.log)
   >     INFO: From Testing //:platform-rpm-test_0_centos/6:
   >     ==================== Test output for //:platform-rpm-test_0_centos/6:
   >     + exec platform-rpm-test ./hello-0-0.x86_64.rpm ./hello.rpm
   >     + sudo rpm --install ./hello-0-0.x86_64.rpm
   >     sudo: /etc/sudo.conf is owned by uid 65534, should be 0
   >     sudo: /bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set
   >     ================================================================================

   and similar for all DEB and RPM tests. Does not happen in GitHub Actions nor remotely.  

2. Excluding `exec_platforms` from `//:tars` theoretically means it should 
   declare that it is executable on the host: that seems to propagate to being
   instructions to compile `//:hello` for the host too.

3. We avoided having to think about the difference between target and exec platform by
   specifying both with the same values. TODO figure that out. I.e. we should be able
   to specify that `//:tars` _targets_ all platforms, but can _execute_ on the host.
